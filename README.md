# Beginning-CPP-Programming-Course
This is a repository containing C++ projects developed by undertaking lectures from the Udemy course ["Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond"](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/).

## What is this repository?
I decided to undertake this course to fill gaps in my C++ skills from university, and to simply further my abilities beyond what I previously was taught.
The goal is to showcase topics I have covered practically in this course and have code samples as references.
Using both this repo and my notes taken when covering this course, I can quickly refresh my understanding of these topics.

## What is included in this repository?
The repo has and will be updated with code examples surrounding topics covered on this course, such as (but not limited to):
- Pointers and smart pointers
- Object Oriented Programming (classes and objects)
- Operator overloading
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- I/O and streams
- The Standard Template Library
- Lambda Expressions

## How to use the repository
This program was developed using Visual Studio 2022. The solution platform used is x86, and solution configuration is Debug.
Within the solution are folders containing projects. Each project covers one lecture from the course. Select one to run as the Startup Project.
